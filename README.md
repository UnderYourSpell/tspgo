# The Traveling Salesman Problem Go Implementation

In my undergrad, I did research pertaining to algorithms that solve the NP-Complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In a class for AI, I wrote an implementation of the Genetic Algorithm that solves the TSP in C++.
I enjoyed writing it so I wanted to explore the problem further. I also wanted to learn Go as it seemed like an interesting programming language.
This Go implementation builds on my C++ implementation and I hope to explore this problem and the algorithms that solve it by using the Go language.

### Genetic Algorithm
The Genetic Algorithm implenetation is complete. Paramaters are adjustable in main.go.
### Christofides
Christofides Heauristic mostly done.
Simulated Annealing with 2opt swap will be next addition
